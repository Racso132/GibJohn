<h1>Gamification<h1>
<br>One of the key features of gamification is the use of points and badges. Students earn points for completing various activities, such as completing lessons, quizzes, or finishing videos. These points can then be used to unlock rewards or badges, which serve as a visual representation of their achievements.
